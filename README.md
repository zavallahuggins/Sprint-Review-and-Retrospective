# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User stories are a great source of information on what the needs of the user are. Each user story gives a different perspective of how people of varying lifestyles may use the application in their day to day life. 

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I plan to implement the 7 stages of the software development lifecycle: Planning, analysis, design, development, testing, integration, and maintenance. I can incorporate agile processes in this process as its needed. I would like to implement practices such as flexibility in design, transparency throughout the team, and division of progress in sprints. 

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development entails being collaborative. Being productive is essential to having a successful project, but having moments of uncertainty can be resolved quickly with the right communication. If you are struggling, and the team never knows, you are not only hindering yourself, but the entire team since you are not communicating your road blocks. The reason the team is in place is to collaborate and overcome these issues together.
